# Frontend Design Mockups

This directory contains the original HTML/CSS mockups that were created to demonstrate different design approaches for the frontend.

## Status
⚠️ **Note**: The original design mockups were accidentally removed during directory restructuring. They can be recreated if needed.

## Available Designs

1. **design1-modern** - Modern dashboard with gradients and cards
2. **design2-terminal** - Terminal/console style with dark theme
3. **design3-business** - Professional business interface

## Current Implementation

The React application in the parent directory (`app/Frontend/`) implements the **design1-modern** style with:
- Modern gradients and styling
- Bootstrap components
- Responsive design
- TypeScript implementation

## Recreation

If you need to recreate the original mockups, they followed these design principles:

### Design1-Modern
- Blue gradients (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Cards with shadows and hover effects
- Modern typography
- Clean, contemporary interface

### Design2-Terminal
- Dark theme with green/amber text
- Monospace fonts
- Command-line aesthetic
- Terminal-style interface

### Design3-Business
- Professional corporate colors
- Structured tables and forms
- Business-appropriate styling
- Enterprise-grade interface

The React implementation successfully incorporates the design1-modern principles and serves as the production frontend.
